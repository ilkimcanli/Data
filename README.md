# Data
Daylight Illuminance Data (considering surrounding buildings (CIM) and without considering surrounding buildings (CEM)) to train ML models and calculate associated electricity consumption for lighting
"This dataset includes Eaver values calculated using the methods described in the study, for both CIM and CEM. Additionally, the dataset has been augmented with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). It's important to note that predictions have not been made for nighttime hours, hence the data only includes values calculated between 7 AM and 7 PM
